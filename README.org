* Emacs-Kick(starter) for Vim/Neovim Users

Welcome to *Emacs-Kick*, a feature-rich Emacs configuration designed
for users familiar with *Vim* *Neovim*, and *Vi*. With this
setup, you don't need to leave behind your favorite terminal or tools
like *yazi*, *starship*, *lazygit*, and *lazydocker* just to give
Emacs a try.

Use Emacs the same way you'd use *Neovim*, seamlessly integrating it
into your workflow inside terminal multiplexers like *tmux* or
*Zellij*, while also enjoying modern features such as *treesitter*
and *LSP*—no hassle.

TODO: [Insert nice screenshot here]

*Emacs-Kick* is not a distribution, but a starting point for your
own configuration. It’s designed to be accessible to Vim/Neovim users
without needing to adopt all of Emacs' ecosystem. You can still enjoy
the power of Emacs without having to learn every Emacs-specific
workflow.

*Minimum Requirements*:
- Emacs version *29+*
  - You can verify your version by running:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  emacs --version
  #+END_SRC

*Installation Instructions*:

1. *Clone the repository*:

   *Note*: If you already have an existing Emacs configuration in
   `~/.emacs.d`, please back it up before proceeding. You can do this
   by renaming the directory:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.backup
   #+END_SRC

   After backing up, clone the repository:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git clone https://github.com/LionyxML/emacs-kick.git ~/.emacs.d
   #+END_SRC


2. *Run the setup*:

   After cloning, install the configuration by running:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   emacs -nw --eval="(ek/first-install)"
   #+END_SRC

   Alternatively, you can run the provided script `ek-reinstall.sh`
   from inside `~/.emacs.d/`, which will achieve the same result:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   cd ~/.emacs.d/ && ./ek-reinstall.sh
   #+END_SRC

   Both methods will install all necessary packages and apply the
   configuration.


3. *Set terminal mode by default*:

   *Note on Emacs modes*: Emacs automatically adapts to either
   graphical or terminal mode depending on the environment. But if you're
   in a graphical session and prefer terminal mode, just use:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   emacs -nw
   #+END_SRC

   To ensure Emacs always opens in terminal mode, add the following to
   your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   alias emacs='emacs -nw'
   #+END_SRC

   Then, reload your shell configuration with:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # for bash
   source ~/.zshrc   # for zsh
   #+END_SRC

4. *Start Emacs*:

   Once set up, start Emacs with:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   emacs
   #+END_SRC

*Usage Tips*:
- *Leader Key*: The leader key is set to `SPC` (spacebar), similar
  to Vim.
- *Help Commands*:
  - `SPC h i` opens the Emacs info documentation (`M-x info`).
  - `SPC h v` allows you to explore available variables.
  - `SPC h f` lets you explore functions.
  - `SPC h k` displays keybindings.

*Troubleshooting*:
- If you encounter any issues during installation, check the
  `*Messages*` buffer for more information. You can switch between
  buffers with `SPC SPC`, and navigate options using `C-p` and `C-n`.

This configuration is tailored for Vim/Neovim users looking to explore
Emacs while keeping their existing workflow intact. Feel free to
